# skribbl.io Scratch remake
Skribbl.io remake in Scratch. Current version is v0.1 beta

# Playing the game

Play with up to 8 people in a room and try to guess what someone is drawing!
Use your mouse to draw when it is your turn, and use the keyboard to chat or guess what the word is.
Mobile is currently unavailable (sorry COD mobile sweats).

# How to build

- Download the code from https://github.com/3DSdev/skribbl-scratch (which you are probably on right now)
![Downloading the repo](https://github.com/3DSdev/skribbl-scratch/blob/main/media/download-repo.png?raw=true)
- Extract the downloaded archive
- Go to the skribbl-scratch master folder and then the src folder from the extracted archive
- Take all of the files in the src folder and compress it into a zip file
- Go to the zip file and rename the file extension to .sb3 (make sure you have the show file extensions option on). You should also probably rename the file to skribbl.io or something if you want (but it's optional)
- Go to some kind of Scratch project player (such as TurboWarp or just normal Scratch).
- Voila. Have fun playing a broken crappy skribbl.io WIP port on Scratch lol
