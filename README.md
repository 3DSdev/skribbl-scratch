# skribbl.io Scratch remake
Skribbl.io remake in Scratch. The current version will be 0.1 beta (one I release it that is). When I do release it, there will be an .HTML file for just opening and playing in the browser, and a .zip file with all the assets seperated (for website use only), as well as 16:9 aspect ratio files so the game can fit your screen (Scratch has a default of 4:3), and of course the normal archived source files that come with every release AND .sb3 files for opening in Scratch/TurboWarp (I think I will have a 16:9 version of that too, only playable in TurboWarp though).

# Playing the game

Play with up to 8 people in a room and try to guess what someone is drawing!
Use your mouse to draw when it is your turn, and use the keyboard to chat or guess what the word is.
Mobile is currently unavailable (sorry all you Scratch mobile users).

# How to build

- Download the code from https://github.com/3DSdev/skribbl-scratch (which you are probably on right now)
![Downloading the repo](https://github.com/3DSdev/skribbl-scratch/blob/main/media/download-repo.png?raw=true)
- Extract the downloaded archive
- Go to the skribbl-scratch master folder and then the src folder from the extracted archive
- Take all of the files in the src folder and compress it into a zip file
- Go to the zip file and rename the file extension to .sb3 (make sure you have the show file extensions option on). You should also probably rename the file to skribbl.io or something if you want (but it's optional)
- Go to some kind of Scratch project player (such as TurboWarp or just normal Scratch).
- I guess try to play or something, maybe remix/fork it?
